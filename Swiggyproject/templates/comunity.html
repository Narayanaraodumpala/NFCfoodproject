              They don’t set an alarm and wakes up on their own time. They do things at their own pace and try to avoid connecting with their peers for work. They need a break every half an hour and their lunch time <br> turns into one-more-episode-before-I-start cycle. A thali will be the perfect meal, so they can savour it at their own speed.<br>

              <h5 style="color:goldenrod;">2 . The message flooder</h5>

              These are the proactive ones who are always on their toes, sorry fingertips. Your work notifications don’t stop ringing, thanks to them. They are the first one to read all messages on the office group and their reply game is strong AF. Although they’ve got all the energy they need, some coffee will keep them powering through the day!<br><br>
              These are the ones who don’t just work efficiently but also manage to clean their house, get supplies from the market, walk their dogs and even find the time to watch their favourite shows while they’re at it. Just because they like everything perfect, a plate of biryani will work it for them!

              When Zomato’s foodies get invited to a meetup, we could not be more ecstatic. It was the perfect Sunday for Nara’s cozy vibes and sumptuous Japanese fusion.

Moving on to entrees, we were able to choose<br> from four fantastic different selections; Tiger Prawn Sandwich, creamy, tiger prawn sandwiches
          The Ritz-Carlton Pacific Place’s Pasola elevated Sunday buffet brunches to a whole new level! The inspiration came from the farm-to-table concept, and Executive Chef Sean MacDougall<br> and his team highlighted a quintessential marriage between Indonesian farmers’ freshest ingredients and food artisans’ creativity.<br><br> The buffet exhibited the union uniquely, in a series of tantalizing international selections, friendly local flavors and the fusion of the two. <br>To celebrate this, Pasola invited Zomato and Zomato foodies to enjoy a range of delightful appetizers, main courses, pass around and desserts.
